file = readable => who should be able to read it? current reader

how to read user input? => command read
while read input...... variable => user is in a variable
it is five lines script

read from an empty file -> it waits until the data arrives or for no writer to be connected
write in a full file -> it waits until some space is made or for no reader to be connected
open ..

close every pipe as soon as possible

1.
problem statement: implement a program that cont reads 2 int from the console, 
sends them to another process, 
gets back their sum and product and displays them in the console.
if the sum and prod are == it stops. Implement with pipe and fifo

console->4,3->A->4,3->B->7,12->A

PIPE problem1.
parent ->reads console
child ->reads pipe

	p2c
p		c (arrows in a circle->->)
	c2p

inifinte loops in both(p,c)
for p
scanf

write
write (it gets to p2c)
read 
read (from ..)
printf
if ==
break (NO exit so it can wait)
(then loops again)

for c

if ==
break (not exit so it can call the pipes)
(then loop again)


for fi
same

THEORY
when you call pipe
process A which calls pipe
it creates a buffer in kernerl (a square) which is a file desc. for reading (0) and writing(1)
=> it gives you 2file descript.


PRINTF ALWAYS newline at the end \n

sscanf (if probl)
