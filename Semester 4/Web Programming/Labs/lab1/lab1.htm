            	<li>Some stuff about Oscar Wilde</li>
			<br> <p> Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde was an Irish playwright, poet, and author of numerous short stories, and one novel.<br> Known for his biting wit, and a plentitude of aphorisms, he became one of the most successful playwrights of the late Victorian era in London, and one of the greatest celebrities of his day. </p>
        	<li>Some reviews</li>
			<br> <p> I finished reading this last night, and afterwards I spent an entire hour staring into space so I could contemplate over the majesty of this work. It left me speechless. <br>This book is exquisite; it is an investigation into the human soul</p>
			<p> Possessing eternal youth and beauty produces exactly the same effect as sentencing a man to life without the possibility of parole. <br> Both have nothing to lose and morals disappear before the desire for immediate self-gratification in all things. And so it is with Dorian Gray. <br> It's a moral story so eventually his evil catches up with him and he dies, as does the criminal.</p>
